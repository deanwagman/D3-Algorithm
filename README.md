D3-Algorithm
============

Using D3.js to visually represent different algorithms

The plan is to eventually make a clock the sorts randomly generated vertical bars every minute.
Sorting them in an order that represents the time.

The purpose of this project is so I can get more familiar with D3.js (http://www.d3js.org)

D3.js is a crazy cool framework for representing data with SVGs and html5 canvases.
